MLOps Project 2: Containerized Training Pipeline

This repository contains the solution for Project 2, demonstrating the containerization of a PyTorch Lightning training pipeline using Docker.

The project refactors a Jupyter Notebook into a set of modular Python scripts (data.py, model.py, train.py) and packages the entire training environment into a portable Docker image. The model fine-tunes distilbert-base-uncased on the GLUE mrpc dataset and logs all experiments to Weights & Biases (W&B).

The requirements.txt is specifically configured to install the CPU-only version of PyTorch. This was a necessary adaptation (as documented in Task 3) to build the image on low memory cloud platforms like Docker Playground, which would fail due to the full PyTorch package size.

How to Run This Project

This project can be run locally on any machine with Docker installed, or in a cloud environment like GitHub Codespaces.

Prerequisites

You must have Docker Desktop installed and running.

You must have a Weights & Biases (W&B) account to log and view the training run.

Step 1: Clone the Repository

git clone [https://github.com/joelolessayil/mlops-project-2.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mlops-project-2.git)
cd mlops-project-2


Step 2: Build the Docker Image

This command reads the Dockerfile, installs all dependencies from requirements.txt, and builds the local image, tagging it as newcrosoft-project.

docker build -t newcrosoft-project .


Step 3: Run the Training Container

This command will start a new container from the image, securely pass your W&B API key as an environment variable, and run the training script. The --rm flag automatically deletes the container after the run is complete.

First, get your W&B API Key from: wandb.ai/authorize

Run the command below, replacing "YOUR_KEY_HERE" with your actual key:

docker run --rm -e WANDB_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE" newcrosoft-project


Alternative: Running on GitHub Codespaces (Task 3)

This project can also be run in a cloud environment directly from GitHub. This is a reliable alternative to Docker Playground, which is often out of capacity.

On the GitHub repository page, click the green <> Code button.

Select the "Codespaces" tab.

Click "Create codespace on main".

Once the environment loads (it will look like VS Code), a terminal will be available.

In the terminal, run the exact same Step 2 and Step 3 commands as listed above.

Verifying the Runs

You will see the training progress log directly to your terminal. All runs are logged to a public W&B project: newcrosoft-project-2.

The train.py script is configured with a --run_tag to identify the source of each run:

[local_py]-...: (Task 1) This run is generated by running python train.py directly on a local machine.

[docker_build]-...: (Task 2 & 3) These runs are generated by the docker run command. You will have two of these:

One from your local machine (Task 2).

One from your cloud environment (GitHub Codespaces or Docker Playground) (Task 3).

You can inspect the "Host" metadata in the W&B run overview to see the machine name (e.g., Joels-Laptop vs. a cloud instance ID) that executed each [docker_build].
